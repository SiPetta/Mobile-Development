# SiPetta : Urban Farming Consultation Application
Capstone Project for Bangkit Academy Batch 2 2023 led by Google, Gojek, Traveloka, and GoTo

## Mobile Development
The Mobile Development part is responsible for creating a functional Android application. SiPetta has 3 main menus: Home, Favorite, and Profile. In the Home section, users can view a list of posts from other users and can add a new post by clicking the '+' button or 'Add New Post.' Subsequently, users will be directed to a form page to select the type of plant and check checkboxes based on the symptoms of the user's chosen plant type. Users can also add additional descriptions to the posts.
